Oup's purpose is not to evaluate expressions,
but to structure data.

For example

    var a = 1 + 1
    
Is stored as a Oup list

    1 + 1
    
In a dictionary where the key is 'a'.

##Oup List

An Oup list is a list with 'even' and 'odd' items.

The 'even' items either contain

1. Text.
2. Number.
3. Reference to another Oup list.

The 'odd' items is just a 'code' of non-alphanumeric characters.

For example

    var a = 1 # 1
    
Is a valid Oup expression.
